# React Multimodal Development Plan

## Current Features
- ✅ Camera provider with stream access
- ✅ Microphone provider with audio data listeners
- ✅ Hands tracking with MediaPipe integration
- ✅ Composite media provider for orchestrated control

## Planned Features

### High Priority
- [ ] **Expose microphone MediaStream** - Add stream property to microphone provider interface to enable direct stream access for applications like voice recognition that need raw MediaStream objects
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Performance optimizations for real-time processing

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Additional audio processing features
- [ ] Video recording capabilities
- [ ] Advanced gesture recognition
- [ ] Multi-device support

### Low Priority
- [ ] Plugin architecture for custom processors
- [ ] Advanced analytics and metrics
- [ ] Cloud processing integration

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Improve TypeScript type definitions
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Review and update dependencies

## Notes
- The microphone stream exposure request came from cerebellum project needs for voice recognition integration
- Consider backward compatibility when adding stream access
